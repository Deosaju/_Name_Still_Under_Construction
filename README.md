A public good Project !

## **[What are PublicÂ Goods?](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/market-failure-and-the-role-of-government/externalities-topic/a/public-goods-cnx)**

A easy and straightforward primer. A public good has two key characteristics; it is non-excludable (costly or impossible for one user to exclude others from using a good) and non-rivalrous (when one person is using a good, it does not prevent others from using it). Together, these characteristics make it difficult for market producers to sell the good to individual consumers.
